            <h2>Ahshoka Tana the best Jedi in the Universe</h2>

            <br />

            <p>
              Ahsoka Tano was a former Jedi Padawan who, after the Clone Wars,
              helped establish a network of various rebel cells against the
              Galactic Empire. A Togruta female, Tano was discovered on her
              homeworld of Shili by Jedi Master Plo Koon, who brought her to the
              Jedi Temple on Coruscant to receive Jedi training.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Following the outbreak of the Clone Wars, Jedi Grand Master Yoda
              assigned the young Tano to be the Padawan learner of Jedi Knight
              Anakin Skywalker, who nicknamed her "Snips" when she joined him at
              the Battle of Christophsis.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Whereas Tano was eager to prove herself, Skywalker had a
              reputation for recklessness, and they had a rather difficult start
              as master and apprentice. Yet they worked together to rescue
              Rotta, the son of crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure, and returned
              Rotta to his father, thus facilitating a crucial alliance between
              the Hutt Clan and the Galactic Republic.
